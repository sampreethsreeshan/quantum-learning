    "# Introduction to Classical Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal  \n",
    "Understand how classical systems can be described using bits, and how these systems can evolve under deterministic rules, forming the foundation of classical computation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🪙 Coin Toss: A Simple System\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine flipping a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can land in one of two states:\n",
    "- Heads  \n",
    "- Tails\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe this using numbers, we label the outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Heads → `1`  \n",
    "- Tails → `0`\n",

    "Now we’ve entered the world of **bits**, simple values that help us track the state of a system.\n",

    "## 🔹 What Is a Bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bit** is a basic unit of information.  \n",
    "It can take one of two values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {0, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "We use bits to describe systems that can be in one of two configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A light that’s off (`0`) or on (`1`)\n",
    "- A switch that’s open (`0`) or closed (`1`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bits help us** encode information in a simple and consistent way, allowing us to perform operations, build logic circuits, and run computations step by step.\n",

    "## 🔧 Changing Bit States\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a bit, we might want to **change** its value based on a rule.  \n",
    "This is called a **transformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We describe it as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f: {0,1} → {0,1}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- The system starts in state `0` or `1`  \n",
    "- The function assigns a new value (`0` or `1`) as the output\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🪙 Coin tossing example:\n",
    "If the system is a coin showing Heads (`1`) or Tails (`0`),  \n",
    "a transformation could flip it, keep it, or even force it to always show Heads or Tails, regardless of input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Why Keep Output in `{0,1}`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the output as a bit lets us:\n",
    "- **Chain transformations**\n",
    "- **Build circuits and algorithms step by step**\n",
    "- **Compose complex computations** from simple ones\n",

    "## 🔢 All Possible Single-Bit Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are exactly 4 deterministic functions from {0,1} to {0,1}:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function      | f(0) | f(1) |\n",
    "|---------------|------|------|\n",
    "| Identity      | 0    | 1    |\n",
    "| NOT           | 1    | 0    |\n",
    "| Constant ZERO | 0    | 0    |\n",
    "| Constant ONE  | 1    | 1    |\n",
    "\n",
    "These show up in basic logic circuits:\n",
    "- **Identity**: keep the bit unchanged  \n",
    "- **NOT**: flip the bit  \n",
    "- **ZERO / ONE**: always give a fixed output\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tiniest possible \"programs\", and yet they form the building blocks of everything digital.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧮 What If We Have More Bits?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we flip **two coins**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each can land Heads (`1`) or Tails (`0`), so we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `TT` → `00`  \n",
    "- `TH` → `01`  \n",
    "- `HT` → `10`  \n",
    "- `HH` → `11`\n",
    "\n",
    "A system with `n` bits has `2^n` possible states.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of those states can map to either `0` or `1`.  \n",
    "So the number of deterministic functions is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2^(2^n)\n",
    "\n",
    "This grows **very fast**:\n",
    "- n = 2 → 4 inputs → 16 functions  \n",
    "- n = 3 → 8 inputs → 256 functions  \n",
    "- n = 4 → 16 inputs → 65,536 functions\n",

    "## ⚙️ Why These Transformations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computation is a sequence of bit transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions:\n",
    "- Describe input-output behavior  \n",
    "- Define logic gates and circuits  \n",
    "- Underlie all algorithms and programs\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying them helps us ask:\n",
    "- How many steps are needed to compute something?\n",
    "- Can it be done more efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the beginning of **computational complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧭 What’s Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we’ve assumed we definitely know the state of the system to be either `0` or `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes, we **don’t know for sure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a biased coin in the air. You might say:\n",
    "> \"There’s a 70% chance it’ll land heads (1), 30% tails (0).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we’re in the world of **incomplete information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with such uncertainty, we need to use **probabilities** to describe what we know, and learn how to apply transformations in that setting too.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what we’ll explore next.\n"
