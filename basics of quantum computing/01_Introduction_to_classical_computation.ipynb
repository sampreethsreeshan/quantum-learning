    "# üß† Introduction to Classical Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal  \n",
    "Understand how classical systems can be described using bits, and how these systems can evolve under deterministic rules, forming the foundation of classical computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ What Is a Bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bit** is a basic unit of information.  \n",
    "It takes one of two values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {0, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "We use bits to describe the state of systems that can be in one of two possible configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A switch that's off (0) or on (1)\n",
    "- A light that's dim (0) or bright (1)\n",
    "- A memory cell with low (0) or high (1) voltage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bits help us** encode information in a simple and consistent way, allowing us to perform operations, build logic circuits, and run computations step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Transforming Bit States\n",
    "\n",
    "We often want to change a system‚Äôs state using a rule.  \n",
    "This rule is described as a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    f: {0,1} ‚Üí {0,1}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",
    "- The system starts in either 0 or 1  \n",
    "- The function assigns a new value  0 or 1 , as the result\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Bits (0 and 1) are the building blocks of all computation.  \n",
    "When each transformation gives another bit, we can:\n",
    "- **Chain steps together**\n",
    "- **Build circuits**\n",
    "- **Create algorithms** using simple rules\n",
    "\n",
    "> Keeping the output in `{0,1}` makes computation stackable and powerful, one bit at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üî¢ All Possible Single-Bit Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only 4 deterministic functions from {0,1} to {0,1}:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function      | f(0) | f(1) |\n",
    "|---------------|------|------|\n",
    "| Identity      | 0    | 1    |\n",
    "| NOT           | 1    | 0    |\n",
    "| Constant ZERO | 0    | 0    |\n",
    "| Constant ONE  | 1    | 1    |\n",
    "\n",
    "These match basic logic operations:\n",
    "- Identity: keep the bit\n",
    "- NOT: flip the bit\n",
    "- ZERO / ONE: always return the same output\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basis of logic gates in circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßÆ What About Systems with *n* Bits?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a system has `n` bits, it has `2^n` possible input states.  \n",
    "Each input maps to 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the number of deterministic functions is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    2^(2^n)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- n = 2 ‚Üí 4 inputs ‚Üí 16 functions  \n",
    "- n = 3 ‚Üí 8 inputs ‚Üí 256 functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This grows very fast, and that growth is central to computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚öôÔ∏è Why These Transformations Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function is a rule for how a system behaves.  \n",
    "They:\n",
    "- Define logic circuits  \n",
    "- Underlie algorithms  \n",
    "- Drive all computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions are easy to compute. Others take more steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying them helps us ask:\n",
    "- How hard is it to compute something?\n",
    "- How many steps do we need?\n",
    "- Can we make it faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to **computational complexity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß≠ What‚Äôs Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we‚Äôve assumed we know for certain if the system is in state 0 or 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in real life, that‚Äôs not always true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we **don‚Äôt know exactly** what the state is.  \n",
    "Maybe it's 0 with 70% chance, and 1 with 30%.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle such situations, we‚Äôll explore how to use **probability** to describe and transform uncertain systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs explore that next.\n"
