    "## üîπ What Is a Bit?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **bit** is the most basic unit of information in classical computing.  \n",
    "It can take one of two values:\n",
    "- `0` ‚Äî often thought of as \"off\"  \n",
    "- `1` ‚Äî often thought of as \"on\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine it like a tiny switch with only two positions.\n",

    "## üìê Representing a Bit as a Vector\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare for quantum computing, we start thinking of bits not just as symbols `0` and `1`, but as **vectors in a 2D space**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define:\n",
    "- `0` ‚Üí $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$  \n",
    "- `1` ‚Üí $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two vectors form what's called the **computational basis**.  \n",
    "They are fixed reference directions, like the X and Y axes in a plane.  \n",
    "All operations on bits can be described as **transformations of these basis vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Bit Operations as Matrix Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe operations on bits using **2√ó2 matrices** that act on these vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå The **columns** of a matrix describe how each basis vector is transformed:\n",
    "- The first column shows what happens to `0`\n",
    "- The second column shows what happens to `1`\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **reversible operation** is one where you can uniquely determine the input by looking at the output.  \n",

    "## Why Reversibility Is Crucial in Quantum Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "In **quantum computing**, every operation must be **reversible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "  \n",
    "Quantum systems evolve over time in a way that‚Äôs:\n",
    "- Continuous    \n",
    "- Information-preserving\n",
    "\n",
    "> A quantum operation must not destroy information, it must only **transform it in a reversible way**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not just a preference, it's a physical requirement.  \n",
    "If we use irreversible operations, There would be no way to track the evolution of the system backward or forward, which undermines interference, entanglement, and all the core features of quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Identity and NOT are valid, preserve information  \n",
    "- ‚ùå ZERO and ONE are not, erase the past\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß≠ Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can represent bits as 2D vectors: one for `0`, one for `1`\n",
    "- Operations on bits can be described by 2√ó2 matrices acting on these vectors\n",
    "- The columns of these matrices show how the basic input states are transformed\n",
    "- Some operations (like NOT) are **reversible** as they don‚Äôt lose information  \n",
    "- Others (like ZERO and ONE) are **irreversible** and cannot be used in quantum systems\n",
    "- Reversibility is essential in quantum computing because it aligns with how quantum systems physically evolve.\n",
